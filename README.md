# Neural Network Implement in Python

This is my implement of Neural Network in Python, and most of it is a imitatation of NN implement in Matlab, which derived from Coursera Machine Learning Week5's assignment.

## Usage:
`python main.py`

## Play it:
You can modify learn_rate and number of iteration in `conf.py`

**Enjoy it!**
