# Neural Network Implement in Python

This is my implement of Neural Network in Python, and most of it is a imitatation of NN implement in Matlab, which derived from Coursera Machine Learning Week5's assignment.

## Usage:
```python
tar -jxv -f data.tar.bz2 
python main.py
```

## Play it:
You can modify learn_rate and number of iteration in `conf.py`

**Enjoy it!**
